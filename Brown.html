        <h1 id="placeholder">Spoiler</h1>
        <p> Stephanie Brown was the daughter of Cluemaster, a super villian in Gotham City who left behind clues of his
            crimes. When the Cluemaster stopped leaving behind clues Stephanie created a costume and took the name
            “Spoiler”, so she could leave behind clues for Batman and the police. She worked closely with <a href="Drake.html">Robin (Tim Drake)</a> while operating as Spoiler, and eventually the two of them became romantically involved, though while
            Robin knew her secret Identity, she did not know his. Eventually Stephanie learns Tim’s identity when Batman
            decide’s to train her. Due to various complications, Stephanie and Tim broke up. </p>

        <h2>Life as Robin</h2>
        <p> When Tim Drake’s father learned he was secretly Robin, Tim was forbidden from continuing, so Stephanie made
            her own Robin costume and went to the batcave, asking to be the new Robin. Reluctantly, Batman agreed, and
            Stephanie became the fourth Robin. Stephanie was more rebellious than the previous Robins, and after
            disobeying a direct order from Batman, she was put on probation and informed that the next time she
            disobeyed an order from Batman she would be fired. A short time later during a fight, Batman told Robin to
            stay in the bat-plane while he went to fight the assassin. Robin thought Batman was in danger when their
            communication was suddenly cut off, so she disobeyed his orders and tried to help. She was captured and used
            as a hostage, allowing the assasin to escape, resulting in her being removed from the role of Robin.
        </p>

        <h2>Batgirl</h2>
        <p>Shortly after being fired Stephanie put on her Spoiler suit and tried to enact a plan she’d taken from the
            batcave. Unfortunatly the plan resulted in her being captured and killed by Black Mask, one of the crime
            lords in Gotham. It later turned out that her death was faked, and she would continue as Spoiler, becoming
            close friends with Cassandra Cain, who was Batgirl at the time.</p>
        <p>When Batman died and Dick Grayson took over,
            Cassandra gave the Batgirl suit to Stephanie. Barbara Gordon, the original Batgirl who became Oracle after
            an injury, acting as a hacker and information relayer was skeptical of Stephanie’s capabilities however.
            Eventually Barbara was convinced to help Stephanie become Batgirl.
            Later both Cassandra and Stephanie would use the name Batgirl, both directed by Barbara.
        </p>
