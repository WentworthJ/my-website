        <h1 id="placeholder">Early Life</h1>
        <p> When Tim Drake was very young, he went with his parents to watch the Flying Graysons perform.
            It was the same performance where <a href="Grayson.html">Dick Grayson's</a> parents were killed and he was
            adopted by Bruce Wayne.
            By the age of 9 Tim learned that the secret identity of Robin was Dick Grayson,
            after seeing Robin perform a quadruple somersault that he recognized from Dick’s performance as a Flying
            Grayson,
            and also made the connection of Bruce being Batman. This inspired Tim to work on his own acrobatics and
            detctive skills,
            though he didn’t have any intention at the time to work with Batman. Tim would later notice when Dick
            Grayson became Nightwing and <a href="Todd.html">Jason Todd</a> took over as the new Robin.
            After Jason died at the hands of the Joker, Tim noticed that Batman was becoming more angry and aggresive,
            and came to the conclusion that he needed a Robin to help him from becoming to enveloped in crime fighting.
            Tim went to Dick Grayson to convince him to become Robin again, but Dick had put that part of his life
            behind him,
            so Tim went to Wayne Manor with Dick and basically told Bruce that he was going to be the new Robin.
            After some convincing, Bruce eventually agreed, and Tim became the third official Robin.</p>

        <h2>Life as Robin</h2>
        <p> While serving the same overall purpose as both Dick and Jason had, Tim proved to be an incredible detective
            while working with Batman,
            almost equal and with the potential to be better than Batman himself.
            Tim was the first Robin to seek out Batman, instead of being adopted, and had less issues with Batman as
            they worked together,
            though Batman himself most likley also improved after the previous two Robins.
        </p>

        <h2>Red Robin</h2>

        <p>When Batman died (he gets better, its comics) Dick Grayson took over the role of Batman, and didn’t want Tim
            to work under him, beliving that they were equals, and instead wanted to train Damian Wayne, Bruce’s
            biological son, as Robin. Tim took the name “Red Robin” (no relation to the restaurant) and donning a new
            costume, operated as his own hero,
            while also searching for Bruce, who he belived to still be alive. He eventually found him, but even though
            Bruce became Batman once again, Tim remained Red Robin, and Bruce continued to train Damian.

        <h1>Effect on Batman</h1>
        <p>Tim was the first Robin to realise that Robin was necessary for Batman, and also made Batman realise it to a
            degree as well.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: Tim was the Robin that finally introduced pants into the Robin costume</p>
