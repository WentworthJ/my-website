    <h1>Under Construction</h1>
    <p> Richard "Dick" Grayson was the youngest member of a troupe of acrobats known as "The Flying Graysons" until his parents died after a mob boss sabatoged their equipment.</p>
    <p>Bruce Wayne was attending the show when the Graysns died and eventually
         decided to adopt Dick Grayson. When Dick discoverd that Bruce Wayne was secretly Batman, 
         Bruce decided to take him on as a sidekick under the name Robin and together they avenged Dick's parents.
        </p>
        <h2>Life as Robin</h2>
        <p>As Robin Dick was known as "The Boy Wonder" and work with Batman for many years, and became close friends
            with Batgirl, another vigilante who he would eventually learn was Barbara Gordon, the daughter of commissioner Gordon.
            As his partnership with Batman continued, Dick began to disagree with Batman on various points. Though he considered Batman's cause to be a good one
            Dick also belived that Batman wast too violent and didn't do enough to truly help the citizens of Gotham.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually, as a young adult the void between Dick and Batman became too large, and Dick left behind the mantle of Robin, moving to Blüdhaven to become his own superhero</p>
        <h2>Life as Nightwing</h2>
        <p>After needing a new name for himself Dick Grayson talked with Superman, who told him the story of Nightwing.
            Nightwing was a Kryptonian vigilante who had been cast out from his family. Due to the similarity Dick adopted the name for himself
            and defended Blüdhaven as Nightwing.
        </p>
        <p>Nightwing continued to have close connections with most members of Batman's family, and eventually
            his relatonship with Batman improved enough for them to be on speaking terms, though it was never the same as when
            they were the dynamic duo.

        <h1>Effect on Batman</h1>
        <p>Robin helped Batman become more human. Despite their eventual falling out, Dick Grayson helped both Batman and Bruce Wayne.
            Having a close ally helped Batman say grounded, and prevented him from falling too deeply into the Batman persona
            and becoming separated from reality.</p>
            <p> Dick Grayson's role as Robin didn't strike fear into criminals as much as Batman,
            but instead acted more as hope for the victims. Though he doesn't always realise, the same hope is given to Batman.

            After Dick became Nightwing, Batman was proud of him and had regrets about how he had acted, allowing him to grow as a person.
