        <h1 id="placeholder">Early Life</h1>
        <p> Jason Tood was an orphaned teenager living alone in Gotham city, who had resorted to crime.
            He was caught by Batman when trying to steal the wheels off the batmobile. Instead of sending him to the
            authorities, Batman decided to train Jason as a new Robin,
            after <a href="Grayson.html">Dick Grayson</a> had left the role. </p>

        <h2>Life as Robin</h2>
        <p> For a while, Jason loyally fought alongside Batman, and was noticably more violent thatn his predecessor.
            Jason was more rebellious, and wasn't as dedicated to not killing as Batman was. One night Robin went alone
            after an abuser, who was discovered to have mysteriously fallen to his death the next day. Eventually, he
            left on his own to fight the Joker.
            The Joker ended up torturing and killing Jason.
            Batman arrived to find Jason's body, but did not break his rule, and did not kill the joker.
        </p>

        <h2>The Red Hood</h2>
        <p>Unbeknownst to Batman, Jason was eventually revived in the lazarus pit. A magical pit that can extend life,
            or in this case bring someone back from the dead. When Jason came back, he was furious that Batman had not
            killed the Joker, but had also replaced him with a new Robin: Tim Drake.
        </p>
        <p>Jason took up the title of Red Hood, a name that the Joker had once used. As Red Hood Jason continued to
            fight crime, though he had no issue killing when he belived it to be necessary. Jason felt that Batman's
            original method of just fighting individual criminals had no lasting effect. His solution was to organize
            most of the crime in Gotham to work for him by killing the leaders of each different group as a threat,
            allowing him to take control. Batman didn't approve of his methods and the two of them fought a few times.
        </p>
        <p>His relatonship with Batman continued to devolve when Jason saw that Batman had taken up Tim Drake as a new
            Robin, it made him upset that he was so easily replaced, and that Batman was bringing in more children to
            act as soldiers in his war on crime.</p>
        <p>Eventually Red Hood's identity was revealed to Batman, and he would go back to working with Batman's other
            sidekicks, as well as becoming a mostly non-lethal hero again, which improved his relationship with Batman.
        </p>

        <h1>Effect on Batman</h1>
        <p>Jason's time as Robin was not particularly special for Batman, but his death caused Batman to start pushing
            his family away. Despite what Jason belived after he had been revived, Batman had been devastated by his
            death. For a while Batman had decided to no longer have a Robin, fearing the consequences, until Tim Drake
            convinced him that he needed a Robin.</p>
