        <h1 id="placeholder">Early Life</h1>
        <p>
            Damian Wayne is the son of Bruce Wayne Talia al Ghul. Damian was trained to kill by the league of assassins
            until he was ten years old by his mother until she left him in the care of his father, who did not know of
            his existance. Damian wanted to become the next Robin, but Bruce’s refusal to kill made the releationship
            with his son troublesome, only made worse when Damian attacks <a href="Drake.html">Tim Drake</a>, the current Robin, seeing him as a
            rival, as well as killing a villan. </p>

        <h2>Life as Robin</h2>
        <p> When Bruce died and <a href="Grayson.html">Dick Grayson</a>, the original Robin, took the mantle of Batman, he took on Damian as Robin to be his vigilante
            partner, in part to make sure he didn’t kill anyone.

            Eventually Bruce returned reclaiming the role of Batman, and Damian remained as Robin. As they worked
            together Damian became friends with Jonathan Kent, the son of Superman.

        <h1>Effect on Batman</h1>
        <p>Damian was the first Robin that Dick Grayson had to directly work with as Batman, and Bruce Wayne had to
            teach Damian to be kinder and not kill, helping him in a similar way that previous Robins had helped Batman.
